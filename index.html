				<h2><a name="history"></a>What is the Castle Mound?</h2> 
						<h3>The motte-and-bailey</h3>
						<p>The Cambridge Castle is the oldest known example of the motte-and-bailey type castles in England. This type consist of a motte, which is a generally an artificial mound, and a fortified bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. On the top of the motte a wooden or stone keep stands and the castle is surrounded by a ditch. The motte-and-bailey was spread in Europe by the Normans and it was popular between the 10th-13th centuries. Keen to see more motte-and-baileys? Check out the <a href="#analogues">Similar places</a> section.</p>
						<h3>Middle Ages</h3>
						<p> The history of the castle begins in the Norman times. However, it can be supposed that the place was inhabited in the Late Iron Age and in the Roman times, but archaeologically it have not been proven yet. In 1068 William I ordered the construction of a castle in Cambridge. It was built as <span style="font-style: italic">a motte-and-bailey</span> type from which the Cambridge Castle is the oldest one. According to the Domesday Book 27 houses were demolished in order to make way for the castle.
						<br/>Edward I ordered the rebuilding of the castle and as a result, the bailey was reconstructed in a rectangular form. The castle was skirted by wet moats, and they separated also the baiely from the motte. From this period a curtain wall, a southwestern gatehouse with barbican opposite the moat, and a southern, a western and a northern tower is known. A great hall was built in the bailey and a chapel is also mentioned in the Edwardian times.
						<br/> The buildings started to be deteriorated already during the Middle Ages. Its stones were used for building colleges and houses in Cambridge. </p>
						<h3>Civil War Period</h3>
						<p>In 1606 only the gatehouse was preserved completely, because it was used as a prison. At the outbreak of the Civil War the important status of Cambridge made the defensive function of the castle be necessary. Between 1642 and 1643 the castle was fortified following the line of the former curtain wall. On the place of the former towers bastions were constructed and brick barracks were built on the site of the great hall.</p>
						<h3>Later life of the castle</h3>
						<p>Between 1802 and 1807 a new octagonal County prison was built. The last traces of the ditch surrounding the motte were filled up with building debris. In 1842 the last medieval building, the gatehouse was destroyed during the construction of the Court House which survived until 1956.
						<br/>In 1932 a new Shire Hall replaced the County gaol.</p>

  				<h3><a name="info"></a>Information and communication</h3>
				<p>The development of the present website is a cornerstone of the plan. The information on the place could be available easily by QR code located on information tables in the pavilion. Not only the online, but also the analogue access to information about the castle would be useful. Small tables with a few sentences and pictures could support the understanding of the emphasized view of the outlined fortification. The  <span style="font-style: italic">"up to the past"</span> slogan stands for it: if you climb the hill, the past will draw itself on the canvas of the the former bailey when you look down. If you look at the other side, you can see the present Cambridge. It would be fruitful to mention some important visible landmarks (such as the King's College chapel or the University Library) in each direction on plaques.
				<br>
				<br/>In the future the development of a mobile application would be advantageous. It could serve as an audio guide, as well as, it could identify the landmarks after taking pictures of the view while standing in the podium.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>Information tables about the visible attractions</h4>

							<br>
							</div>
  			<div class="container">
  			<h3><a name="pavilon"></a>The idea of the podium</h3>
							<p>I suggest the building of a small look-out tower on the top of the hill. I would like to avoid the medieval-like towers or the ones which you can meet while hiking. Its desired aims are developing the view of the hill and from the hill; giving a place for gaining more information on the history of the castle and on the visible attractions; fitting into the present community use.
							<br>
							<br/>The small construction would be slightly elevated with a few steps for being able to look through the Clare colony and the Saint Giles church. It would be only light-structured fence in order to avoid blocking the view.
							<br>
							<br> It would be situated not in the middle of the hill, since there is a geodesic fix-point which cannot be covered.
							<br>
							<br>Inside of it the information tables for identifying the visible landmarks could take place.
					<h3><a name="stairs"></a>The idea of the new stairs</h3>
							<p>The present beton stairs leading up to the hill are damaged and non-aesthetic. Instead of them I advice a wooden-framed soil-filled stair. The treaps would be covered by white gravel. The natural material smoothly fits the grass of the hill, while the gravel cover helps the steps. The white color dominates the plan thanks to the closely situated registration of marriages. The wooden soil-filled and gravel covered stair is an environmental-friendly and economic solution.
							<br/>
							<!--<br/>Instead of the present direct route of the stair, I propose a spiral route around the hill. The spiral route would emphasize the feeling of having a full view around both the castle and the city; it helps avoiding reconstructing an original route to the castle; it disables the wrong use which leads to the erosion of the hill. -->
